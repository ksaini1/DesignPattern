Detailed instructions for installing Serial ATA drives in your computer, including cabling, jumper, and operating system information and troubleshooting problems that may arise
Serial ATA interface disk drives are designed for easy installation
With a Serial ATA interface, each disk drive has its own cable that connects directly to a Serial ATA host adapter or a Serial ATA port on your motherboard
Unlike Parallel ATA, there is no master-slave relationship between drives that use a Serial ATA interface
Because of this, there is no jumper to set to make a Serial ATA drive a master or slave on its cable, as it will be the only drive connected to that data cable
You can use a Serial ATA drive in the same system with Parallel ATA drives as long as both interfaces are supported on the motherboard or with a host adapter
This makes it easy to add Serial ATA compatibility to your existing system without removing existing Parallel ATA disk drives
Disc drives are fragile. Do not drop or jar the drive
Handle the drive only by the edges or frame
Keep the drive in the protective anti-static container until you are ready to install it to minimize handling damage
Drive electronics are extremely sensitive to static electricity
While installing the drive, wear a wrist strap and cable connected to ground
Turn off the power to the host system during installation
Do not disassemble the drive. Doing so voids the warranty
Do not apply pressure or attach labels to the circuit board or to the top of the drive
